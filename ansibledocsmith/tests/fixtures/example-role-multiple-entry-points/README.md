# example-role-multiple-entry-points

This role provides multiple entry points and maintains complete consistency between all `defaults/` entry-point files and the `argument_specs.yml` file:

- `install`: Dummy for "installing the application".
- `configure`: Dummy for "configuring an existing installation".

Validation should complete successfully without any errors, warnings, or notices.

This README file is also a dummy file to show that existing content outside the `ANSIBLE DOCSMITH` markers will not be touched.

<!-- BEGIN ANSIBLE DOCSMITH -->
This line will be replaced as it is between the markers! Any content between them maintained by `ansible-docsmith`.
<!-- END ANSIBLE DOCSMITH -->
