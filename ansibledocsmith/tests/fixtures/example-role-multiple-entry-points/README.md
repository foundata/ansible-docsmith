# DocSmith for Ansible `example-role-multiple-entry-points` README (for testing)

**This is a mock Ansible role intended for testing purposes only and is not a fully functional role.**

This role provides multiple entry points and maintains complete consistency between all `defaults/` entry-point files and the `argument_specs.yml` file:

- `install`: Dummy for "installing the application".
- `configure`: Dummy for "configuring an existing installation".

Validation should complete successfully without any errors, warnings, or notices.

This README file is also a dummy file to show that existing content outside the `ANSIBLE DOCSMITH` markers will not be touched.

<!-- ANSIBLE DOCSMITH MAIN START -->
This line will be replaced as it is between the markers! Any content between them is maintained by `ansible-docsmith`.
<!-- ANSIBLE DOCSMITH MAIN END -->
