# DocSmith for Ansible `example-role-missing-readme-markers` README (for testing)

**This is a mock Ansible role intended for testing purposes only and is not a fully functional role.**

This role intentionally contains a major flaws that should be detected during validation, resulting in errors. It is used to test the validation functionality, which ensures that an existing `README.md` (if any) contains the needed markers.

Warnings and notices are typically displayed only if no errors are found, as errors are treated as exceptions that stop further validation.

<!-- BEGIN THIS IS JUST A COMMENT, NOT A VALID MARKER -->
This line will be replaced as it is between the markers! Any content between them maintained is by `ansible-docsmith`.
<!-- END THIS IS JUST A COMMENT, NOT A VALID MARKER -->
