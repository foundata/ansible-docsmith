# DocSmith for Ansible `example-role-simple` README (for testing)

**This is a mock Ansible role intended for testing purposes only and is not a fully functional role.**

This role is simple and contains no critical errors. However, it includes a few minor flaws that should be revealed during validation, such as:

* **Inconsistencies between the `defaults/main.yml` entry-point file and `argument_specs.yml`:** One variable exists only in `argument_specs.yml` (without a default value), which triggers a notice during validation.
* **At least one unknown key,** which results in a warning.

This README file is also a dummy file to show that existing content outside the `ANSIBLE DOCSMITH` markers will not be touched.

<!-- ANSIBLE DOCSMITH MAIN START -->
This line will be replaced as it is between the markers! Any content between them maintained is by `ansible-docsmith`.
<!-- ANSIBLE DOCSMITH MAIN END -->
