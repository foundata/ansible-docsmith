## [Unreleased]

- Nothing worth mentioning yet.


## [2.0.0] - 2025-09-27

This is a very big update, providing new features and improvements. Please note the **small but breaking change in the marker syntax.**

### Added

- **Support for reStructuredText (reST, `.rst`).**
  - DocSmith is now able to detect and use a `README.rst`.
  - The `generate` action was extended by a `--format` option you can use if automatic detection fails.
- **Support for generating Table of Contents (ToC).**
  * Markdown:
    ```markdown
    ## Table of contents

    - My 1st non DocSmith entry<!-- ANSIBLE DOCSMITH TOC START --><!-- ANSIBLE DOCSMITH TOC END -->
    - My 2nd non DocSmith entry
    - [...]
    ```
  * reST: Using the [contents directive](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#document-parts) is highly recommended:
    ```reStructuredText
    .. contents:: Table of Contents
     :depth: 6
    ```
    If this directive is not available in your environment, you can use
    ```reStructuredText
    .. ANSIBLE DOCSMITH TOC START

    .. ANSIBLE DOCSMITH TOC END
    ```
    as fallback.
- **Additional validations for `arguments_spec`.** The `validate` command now warns about additional issues (like mutally exclusive options).
- **Far better Support for nested options**.


### Changed

- **âš  Breaking: `Rename "BEGIN|END ANSIBLE DOCSMITH"` to `"ANSIBLE DOCSMITH MAIN START|END"`** (4864fea, 2cb6f58):<br><br>As there may be more and more additional content sections in the future, it would be good to make a small change now - while the tool is still new and has few users - to avoid bigger breaking changes later. This is basically a switch to a format like:
  ```markdown
  <!-- ANSIBLE DOCSMITH [Type of content] START -->
  <!-- ANSIBLE DOCSMITH [Type of content] END -->
  ```
  What to do?<br><br>Replace
  ```markdown
  <!-- BEGIN ANSIBLE DOCSMITH -->
  ...
  <!-- END ANSIBLE DOCSMITH -->
  ```
  with
  ```markdown
   <!-- ANSIBLE DOCSMITH MAIN START -->
   ...
   <!-- ANSIBLE DOCSMITH MAIN END -->
  ```
  in your documents. That's it. See #8 for more reasoning.
- **Formatting of YAML comments was improved.**


## [1.0.0] - 2025-08-04

### Added

- All functionality and files. I dedicate this tool and its release to the memory of my beloved father, who recently passed away. May he rest in peace.
